## Restrictions:
- Before performing any task the user should be confirmed whether the user is Admin or Customer and for that the user should have logged in.<br/>
- For each contoller we need to provide the login details for implementation of particular methods i.e, if the customer wants to purchase some planter then he/she should give his/her correct name during purchasing session and only customer can perform that action and for that One to Many relationship is established.
- If we want to add some plants or seeds then only admin can do that so here we have provided the validation i.e during adding a particular item  user should give the correct name of the admin otherwise it will throw an exception and that exception is properly handled.
